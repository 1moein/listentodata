################# Analyze ratings data and calculate partial utility utilities ##############
# This script assumes that you have
# designed a conjoint study based on a number of product attributes
# and levels, and that you have collected ratings data
# from a represenative sample of customers in your target market
# on the hypothetical product profiles from that design.
#
# For data collection, you will need to ask
# respondents to rate the product
# profiles from your conjoint study design on a scale
# from 0 to 100, with 100 representing a
# product that they like a lot.
# you will need to put all those ratings in
# an Excel .CSV file with the following structure:
#
# product1 Product2 ....  ProductN
# rating1  rating2  ....  ratingN
# rating1  rating2  ....  ratingN
# rating1  rating2  ....  ratingN
# rating1  rating2  ....  ratingN
# .
# .
# .
# Each row above would contain all the ratings of one respondent
# and the template shown above assumes N products are being rated by each respondent
# where N is the number of product profiles in your conjoint study design.
#
# As an example, for 16 products and 50 respondents, this scheme
# would lead to a .CSV file with 51 rows and 16 columns
# Note, there would be a header row of product names, hence 50+1 rows.


################# Estimate partial utilities ##############

# A technical note:
# This code requires all attribute levels to be unique, such that no two
# attribute levels from different attributes are identical.
# If some attributes have similar levels, you will need to add extra characters
# to some attribute levels
# to make sure all attribute levels are unique: For example, if you have
# two Attributes both of which have levels "Yes" and "No", add the attribute name
# to the "Yes" and "No" values, so that no two attribute levels are  identical
# For example a Bluetooth with Yes and No as its levels would be renamed to
# "bluetoothYes", "bluetoothNo".
