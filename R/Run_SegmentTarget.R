# # Notice that we first make sure the rstudioapi package is installed.
# if (!require(rstudioapi)) install.packages("rstudioapi")

# If the above code doesn't work, uncomment the setwd() line below

# setwd("D:/Teaching/RCodes/Topic 01 - Segmentation and Targeting Analysis")

# # Load a set of functions that the instructor has written
