########### Conjoint study product profiles design ############
# Instructions:
# In this section, you can design a traditional conjoint study by
# creating the product profiles that survey respondents will rate later.
# First, you will need to define product attributes and their levels.
# An attribute is a product feature, and levels are the different values you can have for each feature.
# You can change the values in the c() command below to specify the levels of each product attribute
# You can change the names of Attributes in mylist from NameOfAttribute1, NameOfAttribute2 to names of your choosing.
# When changing Attribute names only use alphanumeric characters for new names.
# You can also add more attributes to the list or delete some attributes.
# When adding or deleting attributes, note that there must be a comma at the end of code lines for
# each attribute EXCEPT for the last one.
# Some examples of attributes:
# Example 1: For a computer mouse, Price is a product attribute and it can have levels like $20, $50, $100
# Example 2: Connection_Type can be another attribute for a mouse with 2 levels: Wired, Wireless.

########## Attribute Definitions ##################
# Use the following template to define your attributes.
# Each line from NameOfAttribute1 to NameOfAttribute4 defines an attribute and its levels.
# you can add more attributes by adding a similar line:
# Mistakes to avoid: Each attribute definition line ends with a "comma", except for the last one.


# mylist = list(
#   NameOfAttribute1 = c("$100","$200","$300"),
#   NameOfAttribute2 = c("A","B","C","D"),
#   NameOfAttribute3 = c("Low","Medium","High"),
#   NameOfAttribute4 = c("Yes","No")
# )

# Great! We are done here; we have created the set of product profiles we need
# to use in our conjoint survey design. But what is next?

# NEXT STEPS:
# For data collection, you will need to ask
# at least 50 respondents to rate the product profiles
# created above on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing a product that they like the most.
# You can show each product profile to your survey respondents and ask:
# "Please rate the following product from 0 (Not like at all) to 100 (Like a lot)."

# Set up some parameters
# Decide what to call your file name; make sure to put .pdf at the end of the name
filename =  "! Results_Conjoint_Study.csv"
# larger =  1.2
# pdf(filename, height=larger*8.5, width=larger*11)
